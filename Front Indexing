limit screws - adjust how far out and in
derailleur movement - cable tensioning

derailleur clamp bolt (forward facing) - sets height and angle of derailleur 
	angle should be parralell to the outer ring
two vertical screws = high low adjustment screws. 
	Inboard = L screw - stops chain coming off when shifting into little ring
	Outboard = h screw - stops chain coming off when shifting into big ring
Cable clamp bolt - adjusts cable tensioning. Can be finer tuned with the barrel adjuster

L screw adjustment
Little ring, smallest gear
derailleur should sit 1mm away from the inboard edge of the chain, release cable tension if necessary

Cable tension adjustment
Shift up a couple of gears and try to go into the big ring
If it doesn't go = not enough cable tension. Tension on the barrel adjuster and cable clamp bolt

H screw adjustment
Big ring, highest gear
derailleur should sit 1mm away from the outboard edge of the chain

Try shift back into the little ring. If it won't go back in, there is too much cable tension.
Back off on the barrel adjuster

Troubleshooting
If chain falls off when shifting into little ring, or rubs when in smallest gear = tighten L screw
If you can't change into the big ring = increase cable tension
If chain comes off when going into big ring = back off on cable tension + tighten h screw

Or...
Sticky cables
